description: 'SPServices is a jQuery library which abstracts SharePointâ€™s Web Services and makes them easier to use. It also includes functions which use the various Web Service operations to provide more useful (and cool) capabilities. It works entirely client side and requires no server install.'

There is no server-side installation for SPServices. You just need to load jQuery and SPServices onto the page to start using it. View the [general instructions](general-instructions.html) first, then dive into the [Core](core.html), [Value Added](value-added.html), and [Utilities](utilities.html) documentation sections for more details.
